# Intrusion-Detection-System
Software to detect network intrusions protects a computer network from unauthorized users, including perhaps insiders.  The intrusion detector learning task is to build a predictive model (i.e. a classifier) capable of distinguishing between `bad` connections, called intrusions or attacks, and `good` normal connections.
